OMG, just wrapped up 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Control Freak and honestly? I’m kind of all over the place right now. The design stuff was insane but in, like, the most bonkers way possible. You’d think with a title like “Control Freak” it’d be all about micromanaging stuff, but nah, it was just CRAZY. I swear, at one point, I was like, are they designing for humans or aliens? LOL.

Like, seriously, who thought it'd be a good idea to put a mini jungle in every single room?? I mean, someone’s definitely gonna trip over a fern or something. And those color choices... sometimes I'm convinced people just want to give me a fashion migraine. You know what I mean? One second, you're on board with the whole minimalist vibe, and the next, boom – neon terra cotta that looks more like a highlighter threw up. I'm not even kidding.

I really thought they’d do more with lighting, though. Lighting is like the one thing that can turn a drab room into something magical, and they just... didn’t. Ugh. But oh, the gadgetry! Did they seriously have a remote for everything? You know how obsessed I am with tech, right? But even I couldn’t keep up. There was a moment where I was just like, maybe I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and take notes later, you know? Catch all the deets I missed.

> What was up with those crazy chairs? They looked like something out of a sci-fi novel. Like, are they even comfy? Who sits in those things?! And, oh, don't get me started on the wallpaper. My eyes are split between thinking it’s a masterpiece and a mess. It’s like the designer had, I dunno, an existential crisis and then just went, “Hey, let's make this room look like a kaleidoscope exploded!”

And yeah, I guess part of it was kinda cool, but also like, tone it down a notch, guys. I’d rather a room be a bit over-the-top than boring, though, any day of the week. There’s this moment in the  , right, where they really nail it with this one desk setup and I'm sitting there like, if I could just have that one thing, my office would be perfect and I could totally live with it. And then, boom, they ruin it with a chair that looks like it’s from outer space. WHAT?

Honestly, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   was probably more exhausting than any marathon. My brain feels fried. Can't lie though, I still got kinda inspired to mess around with some wild stuff in my next project. Gotta keep it on the edge, ya know? But first, I’m just gonna chill and let all that craziness marinate in my head before tackling my clients' stuff again.

print(Just because...)

Anyway, I'm rambling. Thanks for listening to me rant about this wild ride! Talk later? I've got to go unwind, maybe with a less dramatic   this time. Or maybe I’ll just stare at a blank wall for a bit, sounds calming, haha. Cheers!
